# MCP Stdio Node Fallback (Electron Node)

## Goal

Many plugin and user MCP servers start with `command: "node"` or `command: "npx"`. On a desktop
machine without Node.js these servers fail with `spawn ENOENT`. The desktop agent already runs on
the Node runtime inside Electron (`docs/runtime-tools/agent-electron-node-runtime.md`). This spec
lets stdio MCP servers use that same runtime, plus a bundled npm, when the machine has no Node.

The user's own Node, npm and npx always win. The fallback only fills a gap.

## Scope

In scope:

- Every stdio MCP server that the agent starts (plugin servers and user/project config servers).
- The commands `node`, `npm` and `npx`, at the top level (`command`) and inside the server's own
  process tree (shebangs such as `#!/usr/bin/env node`, `sh -c "node ..."`, npm bin shims).
- macOS, Linux and Windows desktop packages. The desktop dev chain gets the `node` fallback only
  (see Bundled npm).

Out of scope:

- Plain Node CLI, SEA binaries and remote hosts. Remote agents keep the existing rule in
  `prependRunningNodeDirectory` (the agent's real Node directory goes on PATH when PATH has no `node`).
- Hooks, the Bash tool and background terminals. They keep the user's PATH unchanged.
- Other runtimes (`uvx`, `python`, `bun`, `deno`).

## Process Chain

```text
Desktop host (Electron utilityProcess)
 └─ agent: <Electron> zcode.cjs app-server        (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1)
     └─ MCP stdio spawn (MCP SDK → cross-spawn; resolves PATH + PATHEXT from the child env)
         env.PATH = <user PATH> <delimiter> <cliStorageRoot>/node-fallback/v1
         env.ZCODE_NODE_FALLBACK_EXEC_PATH = <Electron executable>
         env.ZCODE_NODE_FALLBACK_NPM_ROOT  = <bundled npm package root>

         "node server.js" ─ user node on PATH? ── yes → user node
                                               └─ no  → shim node → <Electron> server.js
         "npx -y pkg"     ─ user npx on PATH?  ── yes → user npx
                                               └─ no  → shim npx  → <Electron> <npm>/bin/npx-cli.js
                                                         └─ pkg bin "#!/usr/bin/env node" → PATH → node (same rule)
```

## Activation

- Bootstrap creates the fallback provider only when the agent itself runs on Electron Node
  (`process.versions.electron` is defined). Otherwise the MCP adapter gets no provider and the env
  is unchanged.
- The MCP adapter receives the provider by injection (`CreateMcpAdapterOptions.nodeFallback`).
  The adapter does not detect Electron itself.
- The provider prepares the shim directory lazily, on the first stdio connection. The result
  (or the failure) is memoized for the provider's lifetime.
- Waiting for that preparation is part of the connection: it uses the connection's `timeoutMs`
  and its cancel signal. A timeout or a cancel fails the connection through the normal failure
  path. A connection never stays `connecting` because preparation does not finish.
- If preparation fails, the provider logs one `warn` and returns no fallback. Connections continue
  with the unchanged env, so the user sees the normal `spawn ENOENT` failure.

## Shim Directory

Location: `<cliStorageRoot>/node-fallback/v1/`. The `v1` segment is the shim layout version. A
change to shim content must bump it, so a running shim file is never rewritten with new content.

Files:

| Platform | Files                            | Mode |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ---- |
| POSIX    | `node`, `npm`, `npx`             | 0755 |
| Windows  | `node.cmd`, `npm.cmd`, `npx.cmd` | -    |

Rules:

- Shim content is static. It contains no machine paths; it reads the two env vars below. So every
  app version, workspace and AppImage mount shares the same files, and concurrent agents write the
  same bytes.
- The provider compares each file with the expected content (and, on POSIX, the exec bits). It
  writes only on a difference, through a unique temp file plus `rename`.
- All three shims are always written. When the bundled npm is missing, `npm`/`npx` shims fail with
  a clear message instead of `ENOENT`.

Each shim:

- Fails with exit code 127 and a one-line stderr message when a required env var is missing.
- Sets `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, then replaces itself with the Electron executable
  (`exec` on POSIX; the last batch command on Windows, so the exit code passes through).
- `npm`/`npx` shims also set `npm_config_update_notifier=false` when the user has not set it. The
  bundled npm must not ask the user to upgrade a global npm that does not exist.

`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` stays in the env of the MCP server's children on purpose. Node's
`child_process.fork()` and many tools spawn `process.execPath`, which is the Electron executable.
Without the variable those children would start a full Electron app.

## Environment Contract

The agent adds these variables only to stdio MCP child envs. The agent never reads them itself, and
users do not configure them.

| Variable                        | Value                                                      | Used by            | Missing        |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `ZCODE_NODE_FALLBACK_EXEC_PATH` | Absolute path of the agent's `process.execPath` (Electron) | all shims          | shim exits 127 |
| `ZCODE_NODE_FALLBACK_NPM_ROOT`  | Absolute path of the bundled npm package root              | `npm`, `npx` shims | shim exits 127 |

`ZCODE_NODE_FALLBACK_NPM_ROOT` is omitted when no bundled npm is found.

Merge order for the stdio child env:

1. `buildMcpStdioEnv` (sanitized agent env, network passthrough, remote Node directory rule).
2. The server's own `env` from its config.
3. Node fallback: append the shim directory as the **last** PATH entry and set the two variables.

Step 3 runs after the server `env`, so a server that sets its own `PATH` still gets the fallback at
the end. The entry is not added twice.

PATH key on Windows: environment names are case-insensitive, so `Path` and `PATH` are the same
variable. Step 3 starts from the variant that was merged last (the server's value when it sets one),
removes every case variant, and writes exactly one key, `PATH`. The uppercase spelling is required:

- The MCP SDK spawns with `{ PATH: process.env.PATH, ...env }`. If the env still held only `Path`,
  the child env would carry both keys.
- With both keys, cross-spawn resolves the command with the last key (`Path`), but Node passes the
  first key in sorted order (`PATH`, without the shim directory) to the child. The top-level command
  starts, and every nested `node` (for example a package bin started by `npx`) fails.

On POSIX only the exact key `PATH` is used.

## Bundled npm

- Version and registry sha512 are pinned in `packages/desktop/scripts/bundled-npm-assets.mjs`
  (`npm@12.2.0`). Its `engines.node` must accept the Electron Node version.
- npm is **not** a pnpm dependency. The repo uses `node-linker=hoisted`, so an `npm` package would
  link `npm`/`npx` into the root `node_modules/.bin` and shadow every developer's own npm.
- Packaging: `prepare:agent-bundle` downloads the registry tarball, checks its sha512, caches it in
  `node_modules/.cache/zcode-bundled-npm/`, and copies the package into
  `bundled-agents/<platform>/glm/node-runtime/npm` (resources `glm/node-runtime/npm` in the app).
  The top-level `docs/` and `man/` directories are left out (`npm help` is not supported). License
  files of npm and of its bundled dependencies stay in the copied tree.
- Runtime lookup: `<dir>/node-runtime/npm` for the entry file directory, then for the bundle
  directory. There is no cwd candidate, so a workspace cannot inject its own npm.
- A candidate is valid only when `bin/npm-cli.js` and `bin/npx-cli.js` exist.
- The desktop dev chain runs `apps/zcode-cli/packages/cli/dist/zcode.cjs`, which has no staged npm.
  There the `node` shim works and the `npm`/`npx` shims exit 127 with the missing-variable message.

## Observability

- `info` `mcp.node_fallback.ready` once per provider: `binDir`, `hasNpm`.
- `warn` `mcp.node_fallback.unavailable` once per provider: error message.
- Bootstrap creates one provider per MCP wiring site (the protocol connection pool, and the
  standalone app adapter). The pool shares it across all session adapters.
- No per-connection logs.

## Known Limits

- **Native addons.** Electron's module ABI differs from Node's. N-API addons work; NAN-style addons
  built for Node fail to load. Users who need them must install Node.js.
- **Node version.** It is the Electron Node version (Electron 44 = Node 24.21). Servers that need a
  newer Node must use a system Node.
- **Windows nested `spawn("node")` without a shell.** `CreateProcess` finds only `node.exe`, not
  `node.cmd`. Top-level commands work (cross-spawn), and shells, npm bin shims and `.cmd` chains work.
- **Starting another Electron app** from inside an MCP server inherits `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` and
  runs that app as plain Node.
- **Third-party notices.** The root `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` inventory is generated from the pnpm
  lockfile, so it does not list the bundled npm yet. The staged tree carries the license files.

## Tests

- Adapters unit: shim rendering per platform; directory preparation is idempotent, repairs changed
  content and exec bits, and is safe for concurrent calls; env merge appends once, survives a server
  `PATH` override, and is a no-op without a provider. On Windows the merge writes one `PATH` key, and
  both the command lookup (last key) and the child env (first sorted key) see the shim directory,
  also when a host `Path` and a server `PATH` both exist.
- Adapters unit: a provider that never settles fails the connection at `timeoutMs`, and a cancel
  during preparation fails it too.
- Adapters integration (POSIX): with a PATH that has no `node`, the shims run a script, run
  `npx --version` and `npm --version` from the real npm package, and exit 127 when the env var is
  missing. A real stdio MCP connection with `command: "node"` succeeds through the fallback.
- Bootstrap unit: npm root lookup order, validity check, and no provider outside Electron.
- Desktop script unit: npm staging verifies the sha512, reuses a valid cache, replaces a corrupt
  cache, copies the package without `docs/`/`man/`, and fails when the npm entry files are missing.
